# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

I started this webpage as a first step into my future. I was very excited to start this bootcamp and use everything i've learned so far. I built this project for many reasons, i wanted to see how code turns into a webpage and then seeing it physically. It is also the first step i take into becoming a full stack developer which is very exciting to me. The webpage i built will help me remember notes and tips for when i strugle to remember certain things. It's also a good way to come back and see the basic code needed to create a webpage. I've learnt so much and i've only scratched the surface. I learned how to use the tools i will be using throughout this bootcamp like Git, Github, VS Code, JS, CSS, and HTML. Overall I can't wait to keep learning new things and see how much progress i make.
